2012-08-03  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* NEWS
	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated for release of version 1.1.5

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex:
	  documented PartonLuminosity(...) function.

2012-07-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  --install-modules, if present, indicates that modules should be
	  installed by default; --mod-prefix=... indicates a non-standard location

	* configure:
	  added support for --mod-prefix, and arranged for default
	  mod-prefix to be PREFIX/include/hoppet + made use of the new
	  --install-modules option of scripts/makef95makefile

	* INSTALL:
	  adapted the documentation to reflect the new module installation scheme

	* hoppet-config.in:
	  --fflags now handles the configurable modules location;
	  --ldflags can now be used as a synonym for --libs


2012-07-27  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* hoppet-config.in: 
	  added error handling in case of unrecognized arguments;
	  added an --fflags argument for flags to be used with fortran
	  compilers.

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  changed behaviour of install, so that it now also installs the
	  .mod files (needed for programs like JetVHeto),
	  without having to explicitly perform a "make install-mod".

	  Also ensured that .h and .mod files are installed with -rw-r--r--
	  permissions (rather than executable, as before).

2012-05-17  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README: 
	  added a note about ranlib "no symbol" warnings. Thanks to Merjin
	  van de Klundert for suggesting this.

2012-05-13  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* README:
	  a few small edits to update things re compilation

	* tarit.sh: 
	  ChangeLog had been left out of the tarball; so now include it.

2012-05-11  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/pdf_tabulate.f90 (get_lnlnQ_wgts): 
	  fixed bug that when Q was too small lnln came out as NaN, as did
	  the PDF (while it should have been frozen or zero). The lnln
	  function now returns a large negative number instead.

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  changed error message in case of mismatch of flavours between
	  PDF and splitting function so that both nf values get printed.

2012-04-17  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90 (qcd_coupling): 
	  added RunningCoupling(...) interface as an alternative to the
	  Value(...) function, whose name was rather meaningless when
	  using the globally initialised coupling.

2012-02-14  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/convolution.f90: 
	  added a function PartonLuminosity(grid, gq1, gq2) to efficiently
	  evaluate the partonic luminosity that comes from the "collision"
	  of two grid quantities. Its accuracy currently relies on PDFs
	  vanishing smoothly near y=0. While this routine functions
	  adequately, the exact interface and internal implementation
	  could change in the future.

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated copyright date


2012-01-20  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  arranged for gfortran to be the default compiler for all
	  architectures (previously was only for linux)

	* scripts/check:
	  fixed bug related to make check on mac (in if condition),
	  following bug report by Aneesh Manohar and Juan Rojo.

2011-11-23  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 
	  updated version number to 1.1.4

	* src/new_as.f90: 
	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	  fixed a couple of issues with double-declared return-value
	  variables. (Pointed out by Alberto Guffanti)

2011-03-09  Gavin Salam  <gsalam@macth69.cern.ch>

	* example_f77/variants/tabulation_example_exact_nnlo.f: ***ADDED***
          variant that illustrates how to set the exact nnlo splitting
	  functions rather than parametrised ones.

2011-03-09  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* example_f77/tabulation_example.f:
	  corrected wrong initial PDF function in the cached part of the
	  tabulation example.

2011-02-22  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	  documented streamlined interface to Pole v. MSbar mass choice.

	* src/streamlined_interface.f90: 
	* src/hoppet_v1.h: 
	  added support for Pole v. MSbar masses in the streamlined
	  interface, via the calls hoppetSetPoleMassVFN and
	  hoppetSetMSbarMassVFN.

	* src/welcome_message.f90: 
	  updated version number to 1.1.4-devel

	* src/evolution.f90: 
	* src/dglap_holders.f90: 
	  added support for PDF thresholds that take places at MSbar
	  masses in the evolution. The type of masses present in the
	  couplings determines what action occurs also in the PDF
	  evolution. This also involved some extra "communication"
	  functions (a little dirty?)

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  extended mass_threshold_mat so that it has all the info needed
	  for PDF mass thresholds not just for pole-quark masses but also
	  MSbar masses.

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90: 
	  added enquiry function about quark-mass scheme, 
	  QuarkMassesAreMSbar	

	* tests/msbar_tests.f90: *** ADDED ***
	  used for checking that differences between different pole and
	  MSbar choices are genuinely of the order they should be.

2011-02-21  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/qcd_coupling.f90: 
	* src/new_as.f90: 
	  added support for MSbar masses to be used for crossing flavour
	  thresholds, with the new masses_are_MSbar argument.
	
	* doc/HOPPET-v1-doc.tex: 
	  added mention of MSbar masses in sections 2 and 6.1.
	
	* src/qcd.f90: 
	  minor reformatting

	* Makefile: 
	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  added an install-mod target to install f90 module files and

	* example_f77/Makefile: 
	  modified things so that everything works out of the box if
	  you're using gfortran/gcc.

	* example_f77/cpp_tabulation_example.cc: 
	  fixed missing include (cstdio)

2010-05-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/dglap_objects.f90: 
	  made cobj_InitSplitLinks public to allow a user to code other
	  splitting matrices.

2009-10-09  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* src/welcome_message.f90 (HoppetWelcomeMessage): 
	  updated version to 1.1.3-devel

	* hoppet-config.in:  *** ADDED ***
	  template script which is processed to become hoppet-config
	  which gives indications of library names, etc.
	
	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  now outputs a .makef95.prefix file indicating what the prefix was

	* Makefile (install): 
	* configure: 
	  adapted them so that hoppet-config is properly dealt with
	
2009-09-09  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* scripts/makef95makefile:
	  fixed typo to do with LDFLAGS.

2009-09-05  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* INSTALL:
	  moved build / installation instructions into here.

	* README:
	  updated this for new build procedure

	* configure:     *** ADDED ***
	  script to allow for new configure/make procedure (autotools
	  lookalike, at least in some simple respects). Is now the default.

	* Makefile:      *** ADDED ***
	  top-level Makefile added to go with the configure structure.

	* scripts/makef95makefile: 
	  added make install functionality, specification of compiler and
	  its options via FC and FFLAGS.

        * scripts/check   *** ADDED ***
	  for running a check on the output.

	* test.sh: 
	  switched this over to the new build and test procedure

	* scripts/install-sh:      *** ADDED ***
	  to help with installation

	* src/f77_pdftab.h: *** removed ***
	  this was obsolete, so it has been removed

	* src/dglap_choices.f90 (dglap_choices): 
	* src/dglap_holders.f90 (InitDglapHolder): 

    	  Following discussions with Wei-Tian Deng, introduced
	  factscheme_FragMSbar, and added support for it at 1-loop; tested
	  the momentum sum-rule and it is consistent.

	  Note that for flavour thresholds to be dealt with correctly, in
	  the initial condition one must set e.g. D_b(x,Q0^2) =
	  D_b(x,mb^2) for Q0 < mb.

2008-09-10  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	results, but was dodgy anyway).

2006-05-10  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* fixed bug in sort routine; more to come...
	* added various facilities to tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	  (but probably needs more work) (still need to add dy_min?)
	
	* Changed some more names (ev_Setdu -> SetDefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Allowed eps to be made an argument of a grid initialisation
	* Introduced query functions for eps and du
	  (DefaultConvolutionEps, DefaultEvolutionDu)
	* Introduced GetGridInfoString(grid,string) to get a 
	  description string for one's run...

	* Changed default global access to be via hoppet_v1 module
	* Changed default Qmax in f77_pdftab to 28TeV (2*LHC rts)
	* Added: src/welcome_message.f90 + introduced "HOPPET" name
	* Added: corresponding mods in convolution.

2006-05-09  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added tests/determine_accuracies.f90 
	* swtiched some errors in convolution.f90 (and elsewhere) over to
	the "official" warnings_and_errors handling.

2006-05-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

  	* Implemented deletion of grid_def's + some more name changes
	(notably, pdfset -> pdf in evolution.f90
	
        * implemented direction=-1 for mass thresholds and tested that it
	works properly, using the tests/birectional_mass_thresholds
	program (and running it with various alphas values).

	* more name changes (extra "Delete") + introduced InitEvlnOperator(...)
	
	* switched warnings_and_errors over to a new version.
	
	* changed interfaces in evolution.f90 and pdf_tabulate.f90 so as
	to make nloop an optional argument, with the default number of
	loops being deduced from the running_coupling object; also
	introduced NumberOfLoops(coupling) function for the
	running_coupling, allowing other routines to find out what is
	going on.

  	* changed directory structure (for now), with a new directory
	tests/, while the old testing directory has become testing-other
	(devoted to testing things that are not directly related the
	program development).
	
	* some name changes in evolution.f90 designed to make things more
	uniform wrt rest of program.

2006-05-05  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved some arguments around for the running_coupling type, and
	introduced an optional quark_masses(4:6) argument for setting the
	charm, bottom and top (pole) masses.

	* major name changes related to running coupling handling --
	hopefully it should all become somwhat more logical...

	
2006-05-04  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* moved holders.f90 -> dglap_holders.f90 (so its name now
	coincides with module name).

	* various name changes in holders.f90 (and global name changes,
	such that gd -> grid and sh -> dh).

2006-05-02  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

   	* some more name changes in dglap_objects; removed limitation in
	MTM convolution on absence of heavy flavour (necessary to allow
	crossing of threshold when evolving downwards, where there is
	almost bound to be some residual heavy-quark piece).

	* one internal name change in convolution.f90 to avoid subsequent
	problems with SetToCommutator.
	
	* merged dglap_objects and dglap_objects hidden (which were
	separated only for support of legacy f90 compilers, hopefully no
	longer in existence). Added SetToZero, SetToConvolution,
	SetToCommutator. 
	
	* removed number of loops from the split_mat type (it wasn't being
	used).

2006-05-01  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * started work on giving consistent names to routines for
	working with splitting functions in dglap_objects.f90
	
        * Moved conv_objects.f90 to dglap_objects.f90, changed 
	  PMat -> split_mat
	  CMat -> coeff_mat
	  MassThresholdMat -> mass_threshold_mat
	  
	* Put some case-insensitivity into the convert.pl script.
	
        * Added version of CopyHumanPdfToEvln etc. where first argument
	is nf (integer) rather than a pdf_rep -- that should makes its use
	a bit more transparent to people. Also switched the rest of the
	code to make use of the new call and removed all prep information
	from sigma_holder. [Tested that answers are unchanged!]
	
	* further name changes throughout

	* added Delete function for sigma_holder
	
        * convolution.f90: fixed various potential memory leaks automatic
	detection of need to allocate grid_conv objects.
	
	* pdf_representation.f90: representation changes now leave decoupled
	heavy flavours unchanged, rather than setting them to zero.

2006-04-30  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* various name changes to simplify life for the user (mainly
	removal of prefixes which add little information and just make for
	more things to remember)

	* added scripts/convert.pl which carries out most of the name
	changes automatically (sometimes one or two resulting name clashes
	then had to be fixed by hand). Hopefully this script can also be
	used for conversion of existing example programs
	
	* documentation moving forwards. Section 3 on one-flavour problems
	is now at the first draft stage. Should probably next move on to
	section 4 for dealing with flavour problems.

2006-04-28  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* switched sort.f90 to be my own version.
  	* removed unused interpolation routines from interpolation.f90
	
2006-04-07  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	* Added the example_f90/small_fast_tab.f90 program to examine
	timings and accuracies for a (by default) small tabulation.

	Default parameters give 10^{-4} accuracy at 3 ms/evolution over
	the small region (Rojo's request: 9-e3<x<0.75, Q<50). Timings
	increase to about 8.5ms/evolution for a larger range (1e-6<x,
	Q<14000) and I haven't checked accuracies (NB 6ms with better
	ifort optimization). Note also that eps dependence in integrations
	still needs to be checked.

        Timings below are for small table, with default parameters (see
	svn of this date!), on tycho and gaia (3.4GHz P4).
	
	                          init (s)   evln (ms)     x,Q point (mu s)
	ifort -O                     2.2       3.0               2.8
	ifort -O3 -axP               2.1       2.1               2.6
        lf95 -O                      2.7       2.2               2.2 
        gfortran -O3 -march=i686     5.9     130               180  
	g95 -O3 -march=i686          7.8      21                22            
	
	* increased default interpolation order in the pdf_tabulation to 3
	(2 was definitely too low and 4 might be better). Found that a
	slightly small spacing than used in the f77 routine could be
	beneficial (e.g. 0.07). NB: haven't checked correctness of results
	with -axP on intel (there are reports [banfi] of sporadic
	non-understood problems).
	

2006-04-06  Gavin Salam  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

	Version 1.0
	
	* imported sources from the PDFevln package, with the addition of
	some f77 hooks and the removal of all the main programs; also a
	directory structure has been introduced so that the library source
	in is src/ while the example and testing programs are in separate
	directories.
